        "The interface used by external evaluators. It translates JSON requests into SentinelAction objects, "
        "assign appropriate routing parameters (like 'priority' and 'team'), and correctly "

        "ticket generation, semantic knowledge base searches, and Potential-Based "
        "Reward Shaping (giving dense incremental rewards rather than sparse binary rewards), we "
